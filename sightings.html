          <h3>Tree Octopus Sightings</h3>

          <p>Tree octopus species, including the endangered Pacific
          Northwest Tree Octopus, are some of the most elusive creatures
          known to Man. Not many researchers have managed to photograph
          them in the wild and those few in captivity tend to hide in
          inaccessable corners of their cages, as if purposefully
          avoiding the prying of humans.</p>

          <p>Any Tree Octopus sighting should be sent to <a
            href="mailto:lyle@zapatopi.net?subject=Tree Octopus
            Sighting">lyle@zapatopi.net</a>. If it adds significantly to
          Tree Octopus research it may end up on this page.</p>

            <h4 class="subject">2010-12-16</h4>
            <p>Hello!<br>
            A few days ago I stumbled across some information about the
            Pacific  
            Northwest Tree Octopus on the web, so I decided to look for
            a specimen  
            in my area.  I was happy to discover a tree octopus living
            comfortably  
            in a tree near my house.  I excitedly took out a dollar bill
            for its  
            nest, and left it at the base of the tree trunk.  I dashed
            inside to  
            get my camera, and took this picture just before the
            magnificent  
            little creature crawled into its nest.  I've seen this tree
            octopus  
            and maybe a couple others a few times since. I really hope
            this photo  
            adds to your research.<br>
            Sincerely,<br>
            John C. Lawson</p>

          <p>A report of tragedy among the already endangered tree
          octopus population:</p>
          <div class="letter">
            <h4 class="subject">2010-03-24: "Tree Octopi tragedy"</h4>
            <p>While enjoying a break from shooting one of my films, I
            was vacationing on the west coast, visiting a friend.
            Inbetween our extensive debates on international politics
            and the environment, we happen to stroll the grounds of his
            estate. His home is set adjacent to the beautifully scenic
            Olympic National Park. The air was tinged with smoke from
            the nearby Constantine fire, which was happening at the
            time. It wasn't long before I noticed something strange at
            my feet, an entire pod of 30 to 40 Pacific Northwest tree
            octopi were littering his lawn. The poor creatures had
            obviously been driven from the moisture of their forest
            homes and were desperately migrating toward the safety of
            the nearby Hood Canal. Tearfully, we collected several of
            the dehydrated animals and tried to nurture them back to
            health, but to no avail. I have attached [photos] of one of
            the Octopi for you to use to raise awareness to the
            continued plight of the species.</p>
