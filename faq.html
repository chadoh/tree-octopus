            <dt>
              "Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus" or "Pacific Northwestern Tree Octopus"?
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>"Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus" is the correct popular
              name for <i>Octopus paxarbolis</i>. "Pacific Northwestern
              Tree Octopus" is erroneous, much like using "Canadian Geese"
              instead of "Canada Geese".</p>
            </dd>


            <a id="octoplural"></a>
            <dt>"Octopuses" or "octopi"?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Both "octopuses" and "octopi" are considered acceptable
              plural forms of "octopus". However, "octopi" has become
              accepted only because of its prevalent usage. It is
              technically incorrect. "Octopodes" may be technically
              correct, but is little used or accepted. <a
                href="http://www.cephbase.utmb.edu/TCP/faq/TCPfaq2b.cfm?ID=66">See
                here</a> for a more technical explanation, or watch this
              video:</p>

              <p>To avoid the never-ending linguistic battles between the
              dogmatic prescriptivists and the chaotic-neutral
              descriptivists, we use the least controversial form of
              "octopuses" here (except for the site URL which plays off of
              "octopi").</p>

                <li>This is used by the Chuuk of Micronesia to refer to a
                mangrove tree octopus. See <a

                <li>The katakana-transliterated English name is used
                exclusively for the Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus whereas
                木のタコ may be used for tree octopuses in general. 木登りタコ
                ("tree-climbing octopus") or similarly descriptive terms are
                also sometimes used.</li>
                <li>Sasquatch use subpharyngeal ultrafricatives (Ħ and ʕ!),
                which if done correctly would shred a human's larynx, however
                they will appreciate your attempt using human-range pharyngeal
                fricatives (<a

            <a id="rainforest"></a>
            <dt>Aren't rainforests only found in the tropics?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p><i>Tropical</i> rainforests are only found in the tropics,
              hence the qualifier before the name. However, rainforests in
              general can be found wherever there are both forests and
              sufficient rain. That is why they are called <i>rainforests</i>.
              The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainforests">technical
                definition</a> of a rainforest is a forest that normally gets
              no less than 1750-2000 mm (68-78 inches) of rain a year. In
              Cascadia, <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_temperate_rain_forests">our
                rainforests</a> are called <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_rainforest"><i>temperate</i>
                rainforests</a>, since we are in the temperate region.</p>

            <a id="sasquatch"></a>
            <dt>Why are Sasquatch allowed to gather Tree Octopuses if the
            octopuses are endangered?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>No one allows a Sasquatch to do anything; they just do
              it.</p>

              <p>Sasquatch have been gathering Tree Octopuses since before
              Humans settled in their habitats. They form a symbiotic
              relationship. We value our limbs and don't question this.</p>
            </dd>


            <a id="profit"></a>
            <dt>What percentage of profit from Tree Octopus products sold on
            this site goes to support protecting the species?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>None.</p>
              <p>Tree Octopuses don't need your money. They need your love and
              willingness to write angry letters to the editor demanding
              action.</p>
            </dd>


            <a id="donate"></a>
            <dt>Regardless, I would like to donate money to help the Tree
            Octopus. How can I do this?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>If you must give money to ease your conscience, donations to
              help the Tree Octopus should be given directly to the Tree
              Octopuses. Here is how to donate: Travel to the Olympic
              Peninsula (if you are a minor, ask your parents first). Stand in
              the Tree Octopuses' forest near a tree and hold out a dollar
              bill. If you stand still enough, eventually a Tree Octopus will
              come by on a branch, reach out, and take the bill with her
              suckers. She will continue to return for more bills as long as
              you hold them out, so bring lots of singles. She will use them
              to line her den in the trees, as the bills will soak up rain
              water and keep her skin moist. Given the current value of the
              dollar, this is the most cost effective way to help.</p>
              <p>Please note: <b>don't give them coins.</b> While they are
              attracted to shiny objects and will gladly take coins, the toxic
              metals in coins (especially copper) can easily absorb into their
              skin and poison them. Paper money, checks, stock certificates,
              coupons, etc. are preferable and make better nesting
              material.</p>
