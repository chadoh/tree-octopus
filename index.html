          </figure>
          <p>
            The Pacific Northwest tree octopus (<em>Octopus paxarbolis</em>) can be found
            in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_rainforest">temperate
            rainforests</a> of the Olympic Peninsula on the west coast of North America.
            Their habitat lies on the Eastern side of the Olympic mountain range,
            adjacent to Hood Canal. These solitary cephalopods reach an average size
            (measured from arm-tip to mantle-tip,) of 30-33 cm. Unlike most other
            cephalopods, tree octopuses are amphibious, spending only their early life
            and the period of their mating season in their ancestral aquatic environment.
            Because of the moistness of the rainforests and specialized skin adaptations,
            they are able to keep from becoming desiccated for prolonged periods of time,
            but given the chance they would prefer resting in pooled water.
          </p>
          <p>
            An intelligent and inquisitive being (it has the largest brain-to-body ratio
            for any mollusk), the tree octopus explores its arboreal world by both touch
            and sight. Adaptations its ancestors originally evolved in the three
            dimensional environment of the sea have been put to good use in the spatially
            complex maze of the <a href=
            "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_National_Park">coniferous Olympic
            rainforests</a>. The challenges and richness of this environment (and the
            intimate way in which it interacts with it,) may account for the tree
            octopus's advanced behavioral development. (Some evolutionary theorists
            suppose that "arboreal adaptation" is what laid the groundwork in primates
            for the evolution of the human mind.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Reaching out with one of her eight arms, each covered in sensitive suckers, a
            tree octopus might grab a branch to pull herself along in a form of
            locomotion called tentaculation; or she might be preparing to strike at an
            insect or small vertebrate, such as a frog or rodent, or steal an egg from a
            bird's nest; or she might even be examining some object that caught her
            fancy, instinctively desiring to manipulate it with her dexterous limbs
            (really deserving the title "sensory organs" more than mere "limbs",) in
            order to better know it.
          </p>
          <figure class="photo" style="width:180px">

          <p>
            Tree octopuses have eyesight comparable to humans. Besides allowing them to
            see their prey and environment, it helps them in inter-octopus relations.
            Although they are not social animals like us, they display to one-another
            their emotions through their ability to change the color of their skin: red
            indicates anger, white fear, while they normally maintain a mottled brown
            tone to blend in with the background.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reproductive cycle of the tree octopus is still linked to its roots in
            the waters of the Puget Sound from where it is thought to have originated.
            Every year, in Spring, tree octopuses leave their homes in the <a href=
            "http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/olympic/">Olympic National Forest</a> and migrate
            towards the shore and, eventually, their spawning grounds in Hood Canal.
            There, they congregate (the only real social time in their lives,) and find
            mates. After the male has deposited his sperm, he returns to the forests,
            leaving the female to find an aquatic lair in which to attach her strands of
            egg-clusters. The female will guard and care for her eggs until they hatch,
            refusing even to eat, and usually dying from her selflessness. The young will
            spend the first month or so floating through Hood Canal, Admiralty Inlet, and
            as far as North Puget Sound before eventually moving out of the water and
            beginning their adult lives.

        <h3>
          Why It's Endangered
        </h3>
        <div class="indent">
          <p>
            Although the tree octopus is not officially listed on the Endangered Species
            List, we feel that it should be added since its numbers are at a critically
            low level for its breeding needs. The reasons for this dire situation
            include: decimation of habitat by logging and suburban encroachment; building
            of roads that cut off access to the water which it needs for spawning;
            predation by foreign species such as house cats; and booming populations of
            its natural predators, including the bald eagle and <a href=
            "http://zapatopi.net/bsa/octopus.html">sasquatch</a>. What few that make it
            to the Canal are further hampered in their reproduction by the growing
            problem of pollution from farming and residential run-off. Unless immediate
            action is taken to protect this species and its habitat, the Pacific
            Northwest tree octopus will be but a memory.
          </p>

          <p>
            The possibility of Pacific Northwest tree octopus extinction is not an
            unwarranted fear. Other tree octopus species -- including the Douglas octopus
            and the red-ringed madrona sucker -- were once abundant throughout the
            Cascadia region, but have since gone extinct because of threats similar to
            those faced by <em>paxarbolis</em>, as well as overharvesting by the
            now-illegal tree octopus trade.
          </p>
          <p>
            The history of the tree octopus trade is a sad one. Their voracious appetite
            for bird plumes having exhausted all the worthy species of that family, the
            fashionistas moved on to cephalopodic accoutrements during the early 20th
            Century. Tree octopuses became prized by the fashion industry as ornamental
            decorations for hats, leading greedy trappers to wipe out whole populations
            to feed the vanity of the fashionable rich. While fortunately this practice
            has been outlawed, its effects still reverberate today as these millinery
            deprivations brought tree octopus numbers below the critical point where even
            minor environmental change could cause disaster.
